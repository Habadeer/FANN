Feedforward Artificial Neural Network

I created a model of feedforward artificial neural network.

A feedforward artificial neural network is a type of artificial neural network in which information flows in only one direction, from input to output, without looping back. The information flows through the layers of the network, passing through the input layer, one or more hidden layers, and the output layer. The layers are made up of interconnected "neurons" which use a set of weights and biases to transform the input data into the output. The weights and biases are adjusted during training (backpropagation algorithm), allowing the network to learn to recognize patterns in the input data and produce the desired output.

# TODO

- Adjust learning speed depending on error delta

- Cleanup code

- Add comments

- Add documentation
